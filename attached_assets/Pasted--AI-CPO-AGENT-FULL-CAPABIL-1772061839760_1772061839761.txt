   Generate a structured product requirements document for any
   feature. Includes problem statement, proposed solution,
   user stories, acceptance criteria, and success metrics.

2. Roadmap
   Create a quarterly product roadmap organized by themes
   and priorities. Includes timeline, milestones, and
   strategic alignment.

3. Sprint Plan
   Break work into actionable sprint tasks with RICE/ICE
   priority scoring. Includes task assignments, effort
   estimates, and sprint goals.

4. Daily Recap
   Write a daily status update — perfect for "building in
   public" posts. Includes accomplishments, blockers, next
   steps, and action items with owners and due dates.


FEATURE & ENGINEERING
---------------------------------------------------------------

5. Feature Specification
   Detailed feature specification with functional requirements,
   edge cases, dependencies, and acceptance criteria. Ready
   for engineering handoff.

6. User Stories
   Persona-based user stories for any epic or feature area.
   Follows "As a [user], I want [goal], so that [benefit]"
   format with acceptance criteria.

7. Technical Handoff Document
   Engineering handoff document with tech stack details,
   architecture notes, constraints, implementation guidance,
   and testing requirements.


STRATEGY & COMMUNICATION
---------------------------------------------------------------

8. Release Notes
   User-facing release notes for any version. Covers new
   features, improvements, bug fixes, and breaking changes
   in clear, non-technical language.

9. Strategy Memo
   Executive strategy analysis with background context,
   options to consider, tradeoffs, risks, and a clear
   recommendation. Great for big product decisions.


STRATEGY TOOLS (Sidebar)
---------------------------------------------------------------

10. Product Brief
    Set your core product context — product name, vision,
    target user, current stage, and goals. This is
    automatically included in every document the AI generates
    so it always has full context.

11. ICP & Value Proposition
    Define your Ideal Customer Profile including target
    market, customer segments, pain points, current
    alternatives, and your key differentiators.
    Auto-included in all AI generation.

12. PMF Signals (Product-Market Fit)
    Log signals that indicate product-market fit:
    - User feedback quotes
    - Metric observations
    - Market patterns
    - Interview notes
    All signals are auto-included in AI generation context.

13. Metrics Dashboard
    Track key product metrics with AI-powered insights:
    - Activation rate
    - Retention rate
    - Churn rate
    - Monthly revenue (MRR)
    Get AI analysis including health score, trend analysis,
    warnings, recommendations, and PMF assessment.


CROSS-CUTTING FEATURES
---------------------------------------------------------------

14. Executive Challenge Mode
    Before generating any document, the AI acts as a rigorous
    CPO and reviews your request:
    - Scores clarity on a 1-10 scale
    - Asks 3-5 pointed clarifying questions
    - Flags "shiny object syndrome" risks
    - Recommends: proceed, refine, or reconsider

15. Google Docs Export
    Two options for every document:
    a) Create New Doc — starts a fresh Google Doc
    b) Add to Existing Doc — appends to a Google Doc you
       already manage (paste the URL)
    Perfect for maintaining a running document like your
    "SaaS Building in Public" log.

16. Context Aggregation
    Every document the AI generates automatically includes:
    - Your Product Brief
    - Your ICP & Value Proposition
    - Recent PMF Signals (last 20)
    - Recent Metrics Snapshots (last 6)
    This means the AI always has full strategic context,
    producing smarter, more relevant documents every time.
